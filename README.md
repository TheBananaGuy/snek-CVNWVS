A simple snake game using HTML `<canvas>` element and some jQuery

## Blueprints used

- [Snake blueprint](http://thecodeplayer.com/walkthrough/html5-game-tutorial-make-a-snake-game-using-html5-canvas-jquery "tutorial on thecodeplayer.com")
- [Imagery usage with canvas element](http://www.html5canvastutorials.com/tutorials/html5-canvas-images/)

## Purpose

This was an introductory project during the second day of my Web Development bachelor top-up programme.

## Disclaimers

- Coded for fun.
- Images and base code were found via Google Search.
- The solution is a fast'n'dirty one, definetily not a polished product ;)

## Stuff to do later (and later means LATER)

- Take out inline styling and scripting
- Make zombies not appear inside the snake
- Rescale to regular laptop / tablet size
- Make touch controls for tablets
